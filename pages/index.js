              <p>
                I&apos;ve noticed that some countries get such a bad rap for
                being dangerous just because of the side that stream on main
                stream media. But in truth, these places are so much more than
                that â€“ they have amazing food, friendly people, and rich
                cultures that are worth exploring. I understand why people might
                be hesitant to visit. That&apos;s where Activazon comes in. We
                want to help people feel at ease and confident while they are in
                these countries. With Activazon, you can discover all the beauty
                and wonder that these places have to offer without worrying with
                security and confidence. - Creator of Activazon
