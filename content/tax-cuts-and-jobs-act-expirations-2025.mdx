![TCJA Expirations](/blog_assets/tcja-tax-cuts.jpg)
If you’re an investor, small business owner, or high-net-worth individual, you’ve likely heard about the **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)** of 2017—and that several provisions **sunset after 2025**. What you may not realize is how **local market factors** and **investor behavior** will shape who benefits (or loses) most. Below, we provide both a **hyperlocal lens**—with examples spanning high-tax states, low-tax states, and Opportunity Zones—and **deeper strategy** recommendations so you can stay ahead of the curve.

## Quick Timeline of Key TCJA Changes

| **Year / Milestone**        | **Event**                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2017 (TCJA Enacted)**     | Top individual rate dropped to 37%, corporate rate set at 21%, SALT deductions capped at \$10k, and the 20% QBI deduction added. |
| **2023–2025 (Phase-Outs)**  | Bonus depreciation starts stepping down (100% → 80% → 60%), prompting some businesses to accelerate capital purchases.           |
| **End of 2025 (Sunset)**    | Key provisions expire: Top rate reverts to 39.6%, QBI deduction ends, SALT cap lifted, estate/gift exemption shrinks, etc.     |
| **2026 (New Era Begins)**   | Unless Congress intervenes, individual rates and deductions generally revert to pre-2018 rules.                                  |

## What’s Happening With the 2025 TCJA Expirations?

Under the TCJA, certain **individual and business tax breaks** were temporary. They **automatically revert** if Congress does not renew or modify them:

- **Individual Rate Increases**  
  - The top individual rate of **37%** reverts to **39.6%**, and middle tax brackets will also inch upwards.  

- **QBI Deduction Ending**  
  - The **20% Qualified Business Income (QBI)** deduction for pass-throughs **expires** <InlineCitation url="file-2p1vnpe7kgkqn7vu6twc37" />.  

- **SALT Cap Sunset**  
  - The **\$10,000 SALT deduction cap** is slated to end <InlineCitation url="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/a-fiscally-responsible-path-forward-on-the-salt-deduction-cap" />, potentially allowing larger deductions in **high-tax states** like California, New York, or New Jersey.

- **Estate & Gift Threshold Drop**  
  - The **estate and gift tax exemption** (around \$13.6 million per individual in 2025) shrinks to roughly **\$7 million** in 2026 <InlineCitation url="https://warrenaverett.com/insights/guides/tax-provisions/#:~:text=Under%20TCJA%2C%20the%20estate%20tax" />.

- **Bonus Depreciation Phase-Out**  
  - Bonus depreciation is already stepping down each year, affecting **capital-intensive** industries like **manufacturing** and **technology**. By 2027, it drops to **0%** <InlineCitation url="https://warrenaverett.com/insights/guides/tax-provisions/#:~:text=Bonus%20depreciation%2C%20a%20provision%20of,immediately%2C%20is%20gradually%20phasing%20out" />.

Unless Congress intervenes with an **extension, modification, or new legislation**, these changes take effect **January 1, 2026**.

## Hyperlocal Examples: High-Tax vs. Low-Tax States

### California, New York, New Jersey (High-Tax States)

- **SALT Cap Sunset Advantage:** Lifting the \$10k SALT cap could allow homeowners to **deduct tens of thousands** in property and state income taxes, substantially **reducing federal taxable income**.
- **Real Estate Impact:** In **Los Angeles County**, where property taxes and local surcharges can exceed \$20k annually, dropping the SALT cap can make high-end real estate more appealing to buyers who factor in tax deductions.
- **Investor Behavior:** Advisors in these states report an **uptick in Roth IRA conversions** and **estate planning** as wealthy families try to lock in benefits before rates revert.

### Texas or Florida (Low-Tax States)

- **Minimal SALT Effect:** Because state income taxes are already low or nonexistent, the SALT cap hasn’t been a major burden.
- **Population & Demand:** Cities like **Austin** or **Miami** often see **inflows** of residents fleeing high-tax regions. Even if the SALT cap ends, many new arrivals may still choose to stay for business-friendly policies and cost-of-living advantages.

### Opportunity Zones (e.g., Atlanta Westside, Denver Metro)

- **Capital Gains Deferral Incentives:** Opportunity Zones offer capital gains deferral or partial forgiveness for investments that meet certain requirements.
- **Recent Data:** In **Atlanta’s Westside**, Opportunity Zone investments have increased by about **15%** since 2018, potentially accelerating further if investors seek new ways to **offset** higher post-2025 tax rates or reduce capital gains <InlineCitation url="file-2p1vnpe7kgkqn7vu6twc37" />.
- **Long-Term Outlook:** Even as federal tax policies shift, these zones may attract capital for real estate, small business development, and other projects, given their unique incentives.

## How Could This Affect Different Asset Classes?

- **Manufacturing & Technology**  
  - The **bonus depreciation phase-out** hits these sectors hardest, as large capital expenditures become less tax-efficient. Expect potential slowdowns in **equipment upgrades** after 2026.
- **Retail & Consumer Goods**  
  - **Middle-income households** facing higher rates in 2026 may cut discretionary spending, hurting these sectors. Small retailers might need to pivot to **value-driven** or **discount** models.
- **Commercial Real Estate**  
  - In high-tax states, a SALT cap sunset could drive **renewed interest** in commercial properties. Meanwhile, losing QBI could raise effective tax rates for pass-through landlords, especially in **mid-tier markets**.
- **Residential Real Estate**  
  - **Higher-income buyers** might flock to markets where bigger itemized deductions (property taxes, mortgage interest) become more valuable.

## Diving Deeper into Investor Strategies

### C-Corp Conversions: Benefits & Trade-Offs

If you’re a small business owner operating as an **LLC or S-Corp**, the loss of the **20% QBI deduction** could raise effective taxes by up to 10 points. A C-Corp, by contrast, benefits from a **flat 21%** federal corporate tax rate <InlineCitation url="file-2p1vnpe7kgkqn7vu6twc37" />.

- **Case Study**:  
  - **Before 2026**: A pass-through entity with \$500k net income might pay around ~30% after factoring in the QBI deduction.  
  - **After 2026 (QBI Ends)**: The owner’s top rate jumps to nearly 40%.  
  - **Converting to a C-Corp**: Profit retained within the corporation (not distributed as dividends) stays taxed at 21%. The downside? Dividends face a second level of taxation, but if the aim is to **reinvest earnings**, it might still be a win.

### Estate Planning: Irrevocable Trusts & Family Limited Partnerships

With the **estate tax exemption** plunging from \$13.6M to around \$7M, more families risk estate tax exposure.

- **Irrevocable Trusts**: Assets moved into irrevocable trusts are generally excluded from your estate, shielding future appreciation from estate taxes.
- **Family Limited Partnerships (FLPs)**: You can transfer ownership interests (at a possible valuation discount) to heirs while retaining some control. As one estate attorney notes, **trust formations** are up **30%** this year from clients wanting to **lock in the current exemption**.

### Bonus Depreciation Timing

- **Capital-Intensive Industries**: If you plan major purchases—like manufacturing equipment or data center servers—do so before the **bonus depreciation** fully phases out (sliding from 80% in 2023 to 20% by 2026).
- **Real Estate Depreciation**: Cost-segregation strategies can accelerate building component write-offs, but they become less powerful without full bonus depreciation.

---

## Investor Behavior & Trends

**Financial Advisors** in high-tax states report **increased demand** for:
- **Estate Planning**: Especially among families with estates valued between \$7M and \$15M, as they rush to utilize the larger exemption.
- **Roth Conversions**: Individuals wanting to lock in lower rates on retirement account conversions before top rates climb back toward 40%.
- **SALT Workarounds**: Many are also eyeing **Pass-Through Entity (PTE)** tax elections, but these might be less vital if the SALT cap truly lifts.

---

## Potential Legislative Paths & Uncertainty

While the January 1, 2026, deadlines loom, there’s **no guarantee** the changes will happen exactly as written:

- **Full Expiration**: If no legislative action is taken, all temporary TCJA provisions expire. 
- **Partial Extensions**: Congress could retain popular items (like the QBI deduction) but let others lapse, or modify the SALT cap. 
- **Bipartisan Compromises**: Certain senators have signaled interest in extending the QBI deduction or partially raising the SALT cap limit <InlineCitation url="file-2p1vnpe7kgkqn7vu6twc37" />.

**Investor Takeaway**: Stay **agile**. Even if changes look likely, a last-minute congressional deal could shift your best strategy.

## Comparing Pre-TCJA, TCJA-Era, and Post-2025 Rates

| **Tax Provision**       | **Pre-TCJA (2017)**          | **TCJA-Era (2018–2025)**                | **Post-2025 (Projected)**                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Top Individual Rate     | 39.6%                        | 37%                                     | 39.6% + 3.8% NIIT (for high earners)                        |
| Corporate Rate          | 35%                          | 21% (Permanent)                         | 21% (No change unless new legislation)                      |
| QBI Deduction           | N/A                          | 20% deduction on pass-through profits   | Expires—no QBI deduction (unless extended by Congress)      |
| SALT Deduction          | Unlimited (but rarely used)  | Capped at \$10k                          | Cap expires—high-tax states regain full SALT itemization    |
| Estate & Gift Exemption | \$5.49M per individual       | ~\$13.6M in 2025 (inflation adjusted)   | ~\$7M in 2026 (inflation adjusted)                          |
| Bonus Depreciation      | 50%                          | 100% in 2017–2022, now phasing to 0%     | 0% by 2027                                                  |

## Practical Steps to Take Right Now

1. **Evaluate Business Structure**  
   - **S-Corp/LLC → C-Corp**: Run the numbers on effective tax rates post-2025 if you plan to retain earnings in the company.
   
2. **Accelerate or Defer Income/Expenses**  
   - **Pull Income** into 2025 if rates will be higher later.  
   - **Push Big Deductions** into 2026 to offset those higher rates.

3. **Plan Estate Moves**  
   - **Set Up Trusts, FLPs**: If you’re near \$7M in net worth, act before the exemption drops.

4. **Leverage Opportunity Zones**  
   - For capital gains deferral, check designated Opportunity Zones in markets like **Atlanta’s Westside** or **Denver Metro**, which continue to see growth.

5. **Monitor Legislative Developments**  
   - Stay alert for possible partial extensions or SALT modifications; your plan may need quick adjusting.

## Where Are the Opportunities?

- **High-Tax States (Post-SALT Cap)**: If the cap lifts, states like California or New York could see a **resurgent property market** as buyers factor in bigger itemized deductions.
- **Low-Tax States**: Even if SALT changes reduce some tax advantage, strong **population growth** and business-friendly policies keep markets like Texas and Florida appealing.
- **Estate Planning Firms & Advisors**: Demand for strategic services is **rising** as individuals position themselves before 2026.

## Conclusion: Turning Potential Challenges Into Opportunities

The expiration of key TCJA provisions will **reshape the tax landscape** in 2025, but the effects differ drastically based on geography and investor profile. High-tax states stand to regain valuable deductions, while pass-through businesses may lose out. At the same time, **capital-intensive industries** and real estate investors must navigate the end of bonus depreciation and the QBI deduction.
