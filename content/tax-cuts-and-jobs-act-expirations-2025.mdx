![TCJA Expirations](/blog_assets/tcja-tax-cuts.jpg)

If you’re an investor, small business owner, or high-net-worth individual, you’ve probably heard about the **Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)** of 2017—and more importantly, that several of its provisions **sunset after 2025**. You may be asking, “What exactly is changing?” or “How will this affect my portfolio or business?” In this blog post, we break down the situation with a clear, data-driven perspective so you can form your own conclusions—and maybe even spot an opportunity amidst these upcoming shifts.

## What’s Happening with the 2025 TCJA Expirations?

Under the TCJA, individual tax rates dropped, the standard deduction increased, and certain business-friendly provisions took effect. However, many of these are designed to **revert to pre-2018 rules** starting in 2026. Key changes include:

- **Individual Rate Increases:** The top rate of **37%** reverts to **39.6%**, and middle brackets rise accordingly.  
- **QBI Deduction Ending:** The **20% Qualified Business Income (QBI)** deduction for pass-throughs **expires**.  
- **SALT Cap Sunset:** The **\$10,000 cap** on state and local tax (SALT) deductions is scheduled to **end** <InlineCitation url="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/a-fiscally-responsible-path-forward-on-the-salt-deduction-cap" />.  
- **Estate & Gift Threshold Drop:** The estate/gift tax exemption of about \$13.6 million in 2025 shrinks to roughly **\$7 million** in 2026 <InlineCitation url="https://warrenaverett.com/insights/guides/tax-provisions/#:~:text=Under%20TCJA%2C%20the%20estate%20tax" />.

For investors, these looming changes affect everything from rental property cash flow to estate planning. While some stakeholders may take a hit, others stand to benefit.

---

## Why Is This Happening?

The TCJA included **sunset clauses** to meet budget reconciliation rules, which allowed the bill to pass with a simple majority. Because certain provisions were labeled “temporary,” they **automatically revert** if Congress does not act to extend them. Political considerations also come into play: some lawmakers favor letting the tax cuts expire to reduce the federal deficit, while others support extending or modifying them.

---

## How Long Will This Last?

Unless new legislation passes, the changes will kick in on **January 1, 2026**, and **persist indefinitely**. That said, Congress could step in at any time with new bills or temporary measures. Investors and business owners should monitor these developments closely and remain flexible.

## Who and What Is Impacted?

The upcoming expirations affect different sectors and individuals in various ways. Below is a table summarizing areas most at risk and those that may remain resilient—or even thrive:

| **Sector/Investor Type**                                  | **Impact**                                                                                                                                   | **Example/Opportunity**                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Real Estate Investors**                                  | QBI deduction loss could raise taxes on rental income; SALT cap sunset might allow larger property tax write-offs in high-tax states.         | Explore opportunities in **high-tax** markets if the SALT cap ends; reevaluate entity choice (S-Corp vs. C-Corp).             |
| **Small Businesses (Pass-Through Owners)**                | Expiring 20% QBI deduction raises effective tax rates; must also navigate phased-out bonus depreciation and potential SALT cap changes.       | Consider reorganizing to a **C-Corp** if reinvestment is key; accelerate major capital purchases while higher depreciation lasts. |
| **High-Net-Worth Families (Estate Planning)**             | Estate exemption halves to \$7M, potentially exposing more assets to estate tax. SALT cap expiration could lower overall tax bills.           | **Accelerate gifts** to lock in the current, higher exemption; plan for new strategies if SALT benefits return.              |
| **Middle-Income Households**                               | Higher rates and possible end of expanded standard deduction. However, personal exemptions may return.                                        | Monitor bracket changes; weigh itemizing deductions if the standard deduction shrinks.                                        |
| **Lower-Income Households**                                | Some may see minimal impact unless SALT changes indirectly shift local tax burdens, but less direct QBI or estate tax exposure.               | Could benefit from renewed personal exemptions if that raises the zero-tax threshold for more families.                     |

For instance, a real estate LLC owner claiming the QBI deduction may see net rental income taxes jump from ~29.6% to nearly 40%. Conversely, high-tax-state property owners could regain **unlimited SALT deductions**, offsetting some of their overall costs.

## Who Remains Unaffected or Even Thrives?

Despite the sunset provisions, some areas appear poised to weather the changes:

- **Low-Tax Regions**: States with minimal income/property taxes won’t see as much disruption if the SALT cap disappears.  
- **C-Corporations**: Corporate tax rates under TCJA (21%) are **permanent**; as pass-through benefits fade, some businesses may incorporate to take advantage of this lower corporate rate—though dividend distributions can still trigger double taxation.  
- **Estate Planning Professionals**: With a shrinking exemption, there’s a surge in demand for strategic estate and gift planning, driving new business for financial and legal advisors.

## Tailored Insights for Key Personas

### For Real Estate Investors

- **What It Means:** Expect potential tax hikes if you rely on the QBI deduction, plus reduced bonus depreciation. However, the **SALT cap sunset** could let you deduct higher property taxes again <InlineCitation url="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/a-fiscally-responsible-path-forward-on-the-salt-deduction-cap" />.  
- **Actionable Advice:**
  - **Entity Review:** Consider shifting from an S-Corp or LLC if pass-through taxes become less favorable.  
  - **Accelerate Expenses:** Acquire or improve properties before bonus depreciation fully phases out.  
  - **Location Strategy:** If you own in a high-tax state, the return of full SALT deductions might boost property values in those regions.

### For Small Business Owners (Pass-Through Entities)

- **What It Means:** Losing the **20% QBI deduction** is effectively a 10-point tax increase for many pass-through owners.  
- **Actionable Advice:**
  - **C-Corp Feasibility:** If your business reinvests profits instead of distributing them, the permanent 21% corporate rate might be advantageous.  
  - **Tax Timing:** Accelerate income into 2025 (lower rates), push large deductions to 2026 (higher rates).  
  - **SALT Cap Monitoring:** If you’re in a high-tax state, the cap lifting means bigger federal deductions on state levies.

### For High-Net-Worth Individuals

- **What It Means:** The **estate and gift tax exemption** halves around 2026, potentially exposing more wealth to federal estate taxes.  
- **Actionable Advice:**
  - **Use the Current Exemption:** Make large gifts or set up trusts before the limit drops.  
  - **SALT Impact:** A likely big win if you reside in states like New York or California, since the SALT cap sunset can significantly reduce overall tax liability.
